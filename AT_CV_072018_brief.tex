%In my first industry experience postgraduate, I entered a new-engineer rotation program where I had the opportunities to explore different engineering roles for a duration before final placement.  As a process engineer, I worked under the supervision of senior engineers to troubleshoot day-to-day process problems associated with polyethylene reactors and catalyst production.  I reported production status to corporate level daily and collaborated with the product development group to introduce new polymer materials in the production process.  As a process optimization engineer, I worked closely with an internal engineering team and external consultants to develop the energy-integrated process optimization models of multiple ethylene facilities.  The model results were validated by a reduction in energy cost and an improvement in ethylene product yield after changes were implemented.  I established my career as a process control engineer where I provided daily distributed control system support of the ethylene and polyethylene manufacturing process through the regulatory and multi-variable controls, device tag configuration, control application programming, operator's graphics design (Human-Machine Interface), asset integrity monitoring, and database management.  At NOVA Chemical, I gained knowledge of ethylene and polyethylene manufacturing and variability control of continuous and batch processes with hands-on experience of schedule-driven production operations.
