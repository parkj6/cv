<h2>x86 interview questions</h2>
			<p>These interview questions test the knowledge of x86 Intel architecture and 8086 microprocessor specifically.</p>

	<ol>
<li><b>What is a Microprocessor?</b> - Microprocessor is a program-controlled device, which fetches the instructions from memory, decodes and executes the instructions. Most Micro Processor are single- chip devices.	</li>
	<li><b>Give examples for 8 / 16 / 32 bit Microprocessor?</b> - 8-bit Processor - 8085 / Z80 / 6800; 16-bit Processor - 8086 / 68000 / Z8000; 32-bit Processor - 80386 / 80486. </li>
	<li><b>Why 8085 processor is called an 8 bit processor?</b> - Because 8085 processor has 8 bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Review). Similarly 8086 processor has 16 bit ALU. </li>

	<li><b>What is 1st / 2nd / 3rd / 4th generation processor?</b> - The processor made of PMOS / NMOS / HMOS / HCMOS technology is called 1st / 2nd / 3rd / 4th generation processor, and it is made up of 4 / 8 / 16 / 32 bits.</li>
	<li><b>Define HCMOS?</b> - High-density n- type Complimentary Metal Oxide Silicon field effect transistor.</li>
	<li><b>What does microprocessor speed depend on?</b> - The processing speed depends on DATA BUS WIDTH.</li>
	<li><b>Is the address bus unidirectional?</b> - The address bus is unidirectional because the address information is always given by the Micro Processor to address a memory location of an input / output devices.</li>

	<li><b>Is the data bus is Bi-directional?</b> - The data bus is Bi-directional because the same bus is used for transfer of data between Micro Processor and memory or input / output devices in both the direction.</li>
	<li><b>What is the disadvantage of microprocessor?</b> - It has limitations on the size of data. Most Microprocessor does not support floating-point operations.</li>
	<li><b>What is the difference between microprocessor and microcontroller?</b> - In Microprocessor more op-codes, few bit handling instructions. But in Microcontroller: fewer op-codes, more bit handling Instructions, and also it is defined as a device that includes micro processor, memory, &amp; input / output signal lines on a single chip.</li>

	<li><b>What is meant by LATCH?</b> - Latch is a D- type flip-flop used as a temporary storage device controlled by a timing signal, which can store 0 or 1. The primary function of a Latch is data storage. It is used in output devices such as LED, to hold the data for display.</li>
	<li><b>Why does microprocessor contain ROM chips?</b> - Microprocessor contain ROM chip because it contain instructions to execute data.</li>
	<li><b>What is the difference between primary &amp; secondary storage device?</b> - In primary storage device the storage capacity is limited. It has a volatile memory. In secondary storage device the storage capacity is larger. It is a nonvolatile memory. Primary devices are: RAM / ROM. Secondary devices are: Floppy disc / Hard disk.</li>

	<li><b>Difference between static and dynamic RAM?</b> - Static RAM: No refreshing, 6 to 8 MOS transistors are required to form one memory cell, Information stored as voltage level in a flip flop. Dynamic RAM: Refreshed periodically, 3 to 4 transistors are required to form one memory cell, Information is stored as a charge in the gate to substrate capacitance.</li>
	<li><b>What is interrupt?</b> - Interrupt is a signal send by external device to the processor so as to request the processor to perform a particular work.</li>
	<li><b>What is cache memory?</b> - Cache memory is a small high-speed memory. It is used for temporary storage of data &amp; information between the main memory and the CPU (center processing unit). The cache memory is only in RAM.</li>

	<li><b>What is called .Scratch pad of computer.?</b> - Cache Memory is scratch pad of computer.</li>
	<li><b>Which transistor is used in each cell of EPROM?</b> - Floating .gate Avalanche Injection MOS (FAMOS) transistor is used in each cell of EPROM. </li>
	<li><b>Differentiate between RAM and ROM?</b> - RAM: Read / Write memory, High Speed, Volatile Memory. ROM: Read only memory, Low Speed, Non Voliate Memory.</li>
	<li><b>What is a compiler?</b> - Compiler is used to translate the high-level language program into machine code at a time. It doesn.t require special instruction to store in a memory, it stores automatically. The Execution time is less compared to Interpreter.</li>

	<li><b>Which processor structure is pipelined?</b> - All x86 processors have pipelined structure.</li>
	<li><b>What is flag?</b> - Flag is a flip-flop used to store the information about the status of a processor and the status of the instruction executed most recently</li>
	<li><b>What is stack?</b> - Stack is a portion of RAM used for saving the content of Program Counter and general purpose registers.</li>
	<li><b>Can ROM be used as stack?</b> - ROM cannot be used as stack because it is not possible to write to ROM.</li>

	<li><b>What is NV-RAM?</b> - Nonvolatile Read Write Memory, also called Flash memory. It is also know as shadow RAM.</li>
